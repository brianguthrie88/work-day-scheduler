# work-day-scheduler

## Description
For this project, we as web developing, boot camp students, wanted to create a web application that teaches us how to use 3rd party apis by showing our knowledge of traversing the dom, writing and reading data in local storage, creating elements dynamically in javascript, all through using jquery to do it. Other 3rd party apis we implemented in our code include day.js and bootstrap. These different apis are able to be used in our code by placing the different cdns of each in our html document. All of this will ultimately help us to practice our skills and make us better coders. The problem that was solved is that we were able to have a user create a task that is saved to local storage for them to see each time they open the app.

## Usage
This work day scheduler allows a user to put different tasks they need to do in timeslots from 9am-5pm in the day. The user is then able to save those tasks and through local storage can see their saved tasks each time they open the app. The app is able to show you through color which time slots are in the present, past, or future. Also, the app displays the current date as well each time the app is opened.
